id="incident-management"><a href="#incident-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Incident management</h1> <p>The main objective of incident management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on business operations, thus ensuring that the best possible levels of service quality and availability are maintained. “Normal service operation” is defined here as service operation within <a href="/mojaloop-business-docs/HubOperations/TechOps/service-level-agreements.html">service level agreements (SLAs)</a>.</p> <p>This is achieved through a robust, well-aligned incident management process and guided by a Service Desk system that helps capture all issues, and track turnaround time (TAT) from the time an issue is reported to time of resolution and closure.</p> <p>The process of incident management involves detecting an incident, recording it with all the appropriate information, analyzing the issue, correcting the defects, and restoring the service in accordance with the stipulated TAT.</p> <p>This section collects the main processes, concepts, and principles around incident management.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p> <p>The processes described in this section represent best practices and act as recommendations for organizations fulfilling a Hub Operator role.</p></div> <div

This agreement describes the responsibilities of each internal Support group towards other Support groups, including the process and time frame for delivery of their services.</li></ul> <h2 id="incident-management-step-by-step"><a href="#incident-management-step-by-step" class="header-anchor">#</a> Incident management step-by-step</h2> <p>This section provides a detailed description of the incident management process.

The Service Desk tool is the primary channel for receiving incident-related queries. Emails, phone calls, and instant messaging can be used as secondary channels.</p> <p>The status of tickets as captured in the Service Desk system can take the following values:</p> <ul><li><strong>In Progress</strong>: An incident that has been received via the Service Desk and assigned to a Support Engineer. Resolution efforts have commenced.</li> <li><strong>Escalated</strong>: An incident that has been escalated to any party outside the Operations team, including the Product Delivery team or external L4 service providers.</li> <li><strong>Pending</strong>: An incident that has been temporarily put on hold or awaiting feedback from the user or from another ticket that must be resolved before this ticket can be resolved. <br> <br>
Bearing in mind that using the “Pending” status stops the SLA clock, the only reason that justifies the usage of “Pending” is when client action is required. This has to be an action that is the responsibility of the client/customer or their vendor and is a prerequisite to the continuation of the process; for example, requesting essential information or approval to solve the request. Tickets with Severity 1 and 2 must not be set to status “Pending”. Restoring a service or a function of a service seldom depends on customer action. The only exception is when the customer stops the investigation or implementation of a solution or denies a necessary approval. In any case, the customer’s decision has to be documented.</li> <li><strong>Cancelled</strong>: An incident that has been cancelled. An incident can only be cancelled when the customer initiates it.</li> <li><strong>Resolved</strong>: An incident that was worked on by a Support Engineer and was fixed, and an alert has been triggered to the user to reopen if not satisfied.</li> <li><strong>Closed</strong>: An incident that was closed once the resolution was acknowledged by the end user.</li></ul> <p>All relevant information relating to incidents must be logged so that a full historical record is maintained. By maintaining accurate and complete incident records, future assigned Support group personnel are better able to resolve recorded incidents.</p> <h3 id="step-2-categorize-and-prioritize"><a href="#step-2-categorize-and-prioritize" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 2: Categorize and prioritize</h3> <p>The end user/requester is assigned a ticket number for reference and ease of access when the issue is acknowledged and actioned by the Support Team. The ticket should be visible by the requester (the DFSP employee who raised the issue) at all Support levels.</p> <p>The requester will be automatically notified by email of any changes, status updates, requests for more information, readiness for testing, or final resolution with regards to the ticket.</p> <p>We generally classify support requests into:</p> <ul><li>Incident</li> <li>Service Request</li> <li>Change Request or Request for Change (RFC, such as features, enhancements)</li></ul> <p>Incidents are categorized and sub-categorized based on the IT service or business area that the incident is causing a disruption to.</p> <p>These are some of the sample service categories:</p> <ul><li>Infrastructure</li> <li>Mojaloop</li> <li>Security</li> <li>Settlements</li> <li>Onboarding</li></ul> <p>The severity of an incident can be determined using a <a href="#incident-categorization-matrix">categorization matrix</a>. Based on their severity, incidents can be categorized as:</p> <ul><li>Critical = S1</li> <li>Severe = S2</li> <li>Average = S3</li> <li>Minor = S4</li></ul> <p>Once the incident is categorized, it gets automatically routed to an L1 Support Engineer with the relevant expertise.</p> <h3 id="step-3-investigate-and-resolve"><a href="#step-3-investigate-and-resolve" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 3: Investigate and resolve</h3> <p>The assigned Support resource will be in charge of investigating the issue, as well as preparing the incident record, and communicating with the client on how to resolve the issue.</p> <p>Incident investigation may include any of the following actions:</p> <ul><li>Information gathering and analysis</li> <li>Research, including reproducing the issue</li> <li>Acquiring additional information from other sources</li></ul> <p>Incident resolution may include any of the following actions:</p> <ul><li>Providing a resolution or steps towards a resolution</li> <li>Configuration changes</li></ul> <p>Based on the complexity of the incident, it may have to be broken down into sub-tasks or tasks. Tasks are typically created when an incident resolution requires the contribution of multiple technicians from various departments.</p> <p>While the incident is being processed, the Support Engineer needs to ensure the Service Level Agreement is not breached. An SLA is the acceptable time within which an incident needs a response (response SLA) or resolution (resolution SLA). SLAs can be assigned to incidents based on their parameters like service category, requester, impact, urgency, and so on. In cases where an SLA is about to be breached or has already been breached, the incident can be escalated functionally or hierarchically to ensure that it is resolved at the earliest.</p> <p>An incident is considered resolved when the L1/L2/L3 Support Team has come up with a temporary workaround or a permanent solution for the issue. Workarounds may be:</p> <ul><li>instructions provided to the customer on how to complete their work using an alternative method</li> <li>temporary fixes that assist a system to work as expected but which do not resolve the issue permanently</li></ul> <p>Workarounds need to be documented and communicated to the Service Desk so they can be added to the Knowledge Base. (It is good practice to maintain a repository of Knowledge Base articles, which describe the workaround or resolution steps of incidents that occurred in the past.) This will ensure that workarounds are accessible to the Service Desk to facilitate resolution during future recurrences of the incident.</p> <h3 id="step-4-escalate"><a href="#step-4-escalate" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 4: Escalate</h3> <p>Incident escalation is recognition that there is the possibility of an incident exceeding the agreed resolution timeliness at each Support level. Clear escalation management allows the Support Team to identify, track, monitor, and manage situations that require increased awareness and swift action.</p> <p>There are two types of escalation:</p> <ul><li><strong>Functional escalation</strong>: This type of escalation comes to play when a Support level team (for example, L1) is unable to resolve the issue or stay within the agreed timeline (meaning that the targeted time for resolution is exceeded). Therefore, the case is proactively assigned to the next service level (for example, L2).</li> <li><strong>Hierarchical escalation</strong>: This type of escalation acts as a means to inform all the parties involved, in a proactive manner, of a potential SLA breach. This helps in bringing order, structure, responsibility, ownership, focused management, and resource mobilization for the purpose of delivering effective and efficient services.</li></ul> <h3 id="step-5-close-incident"><a href="#step-5-close-incident" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step 5: Close incident</h3> <p>An incident can be closed once the issue is resolved and the user acknowledges the resolution and is satisfied with it.</p> <h2 id="incident-categorization-matrix"><a href="#incident-categorization-matrix" class="header-anchor">#</a> Incident categorization matrix</h2> <p>One of the most important stages in incident management is incident categorization. This not only helps sort incoming tickets but also ensures that the tickets are routed to the Support Engineers most qualified to work on the issue. Incident categorization also helps the Service Desk system apply the most appropriate SLAs to incidents and communicate those priorities to end users. Once an incident is categorized, Support Engineers can diagnose the incident and provide the end user with a resolution.</p> <p>The following table provides guidance as to how to classify the severity of an incident.</p> <table><caption><strong>Incident categorization matrix</strong></caption> <colgroup><col style="width:16%;"> <col style="width:83%;"></colgroup> <thead><tr class="header"><th>Severity code</th> <th>Criteria</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Severity 1</p></td> <td><ul><li><p>Extensive impact to the business, Production system outage, normal operation is not possible.</p></li> <li><p>Any incident that resulted in a major outage of the Hub, including connectivity of multiple partners/DFSPs.</p></li> <li><p>Any incident that presents major financial risks and has contractual implications.</p></li> <li><p>A security incident with a major impact on the privacy or availability of the Hub, partners/DFSPs, or customer data.</p></li></ul></td></tr> <tr class="even"><td><p>Severity 2</p></td> <td><ul><li><p>Partial outage of the Hub.</p></li> <li><p>Key functionality is impaired with no workaround available.</p></li></ul></td></tr> <tr class="odd"><td><p>Severity 3</p></td> <td><ul><li><p>Minor/moderate functional impact to a single user or small group of users.

Priority is assigned by the Hub Operator (rather than the client) and is the order in which the incident will be fixed. The higher the priority, the sooner the incident will be resolved. Consider the following example: a cosmetic bug like a typo on a webpage will likely be ranked as low severity but could be a quick and easy fix and ranked high priority. Hence, it is important to give severity and priority due consideration.</p> <p>The following table provides guidance as to how to assign priority to an incident.</p> <table><caption><strong>Priority matrix</strong></caption> <colgroup><col style="width:16%;"> <col style="width:83%;"></colgroup> <thead><tr class="header"><th>Priority code</th> <th>Criteria</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p>Priority 1</p></td> <td>A severe issue has occurred affecting multiple users within a service recipient (&gt;50% of service recipient users) to the extent that they are unable to perform their assigned work functions, OR the service recipient or areas outside of the service recipient are affected.</td></tr> <tr class="even"><td><p>Priority 2</p></td> <td>An issue has occurred affecting either several users (affects &gt;10 but no more than 50% of all service recipient users) OR a named power user of the service to the extent that they are unable to perform their assigned work functions and a business unit is affected.</td></tr> <tr class="odd"><td><p>Priority 3</p></td> <td>An issue has occurred affecting a single user OR (affects &lt;10 users OR no more than 25% of all users) to the extent that they are unable to perform their assigned work functions.</td></tr> <tr class="even"><td><p>Priority 4</p></td> <td>An issue has occurred affecting a single user, causing decreased functionality to a single application.
