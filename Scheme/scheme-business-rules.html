The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.</p> <p>The Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.</p> <p>The following documents are part of the project:</p> <ul><li><p>Scheme Key Choices</p></li> <li><p>Scheme Participation Agreement Template</p></li> <li><p>Scheme Business Rules Template</p></li> <li><p>Platform Operating Guideline Template</p></li> <li><p>Exception Management Operating Guideline Template</p></li> <li><p>Uniform Glossary</p></li></ul> <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Introduction</strong></h2> <p>Payments Schemes around the world are in the process of implementation, or considering implementation, of Mojaloop-based payments systems. Mojaloop is open-source software for financial services companies, government regulators, and others taking on the challenges of interoperability and financial inclusion. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding and support for Mojaloop through The Level One Project, a vision for digital financial markets based on principles of interoperability, collaboration, and inclusion.</p> <p>Schemes implementing Mojaloop will need to write Business Rules which govern the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. This document provides a template for those Business Rules. The template is structured as a detailed outline: the actual wording of rules will be determined by implementing Schemes and the jurisdictions within which they operate. In many parts of the document, we simply suggest a topic which a Scheme might want to consider writing a rule about: again, the specifics of the rule will vary by Scheme.</p> <p>Before Business Rules are written, Schemes need to make major business decisions about how the system and its ecosystem partners will work. These decisions are described in a separate document within the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project, “Scheme Key Choices”. People are encouraged to read that document first.</p> <p>Scheme Business Rules Template</p> <h2 id="table-of-contents"><a href="#table-of-contents" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Table of Contents</strong></h2> <p><a href="#_1-about-these-scheme-business-rules">1 - About These Scheme Business Rules</a></p> <p><a href="#_2-scheme-goals">2 - Scheme Goals</a></p> <p><a href="#_3-participation-in-scheme">3 - Participation in Scheme</a></p> <p><a href="#_4-scheme-business-rules">4 - Scheme Business Rules</a></p> <p><a href="#_5-responsibilities-and-obligations-of-the-scheme">5 - Responsibilities and Obligations of the Scheme</a></p> <p><a href="#_6-participant-responsibilities-and-obligations-of-participants">6 - Participant Responsibilities and Obligations of Participants</a></p> <p><a href="#_7-liability-allocation-of-responsibilities">7 - Liability - Allocation of Responsibilities</a></p> <p><a href="#_8-security-risk-management-and-data-confidentiality">8 - Security, Risk Management, and Data Confidentiality</a></p> <p><a href="#_9-scheme-platform-and-services">9 - Scheme Platform and Services</a></p> <p><a href="#_10-exception-management">10 - Exception Management</a></p> <p><a href="#_11-appendix-associated-documents">11 - Appendix: Associated Documents</a></p> <p><a href="#_12-appendix-onboarding-and-exit-processes">12 - Appendix: Onboarding and Exit Processes</a></p> <p><a href="#_13-appendix-scheme-services">13 - Appendix: Scheme Services</a></p> <p><a href="#_14-appendix-scheme-supported-use-cases">14 - Appendix: Scheme Supported Use Cases</a></p> <p><a href="#_15-appendix-scheme-fee-schedule">15 - Appendix: Scheme Fee Schedule</a></p> <p><a href="#_16-appendix-risk-management-security-privacy-and-service-standards">16 - Appendix: Risk Management, Security, Privacy, and Service Standards</a></p> <h2 id="a-guide-to-this-document"><a href="#a-guide-to-this-document" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>A Guide to This Document</strong></h2> <p>Section Headings and bulleted entries underneath section headings are actual proposed wording, or suggested sections for a rules document.
