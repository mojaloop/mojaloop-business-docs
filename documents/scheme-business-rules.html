<h2 id="about-the-mojaloop-community-business-document-project"><strong>About the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project</strong></h2>
<p>This document is part of the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project. The project is intended to support entities (countries, regions, associations of providers or commercial enterprises) implementing new payments systems using Mojaloop code. These entities will also need write Business Rules that participants in the system will follow.</p>
<p>The Mojaloop Community Business Document Project provides templates for Business Rules and related documents. There are many choices involved in implementing a new payment system: the templates show some of the choices and, where appropriate, commentary is provided on how the particular choice is related to the goals of a Level One aligned system.</p>
<p>The following documents are part of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scheme Key Choices</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scheme Participation Agreement Template</p>

<li><p>Scheme Business Rules Template</p>

<li><p>Uniform Glossary</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Payments Schemes around the world are in the process of implementation, or considering implementation, of Mojaloop-based payments systems. Mojaloop is open-source software for financial services companies, government regulators, and others taking on the challenges of interoperability and financial inclusion. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding and support for Mojaloop through The Level One Project, a vision for digital financial markets based on principles of interoperability, collaboration, and inclusion.</p>
<p>Schemes implementing Mojaloop will need to write Business Rules which govern the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. This document provides a template for those Business Rules. The template is structured as a detailed outline: the actual wording of rules will be determined by implementing Schemes and the jurisdictions within which they operate. In many parts of the document, we simply suggest a topic which a Scheme might want to consider writing a rule about: again, the specifics of the rule will vary by Scheme.</p>
<p>Before Business Rules are written, Schemes need to make major business decisions about how the system and its ecosystem partners will work. These decisions are described in a separate document within the Mojaloop Community Business Document Project, &quot;Scheme Key Choices&quot;. People are encouraged to read that document first.</p>

<h2 id="a-guide-to-this-document"><strong>A Guide to This Document</strong></h2>
<p>Section Headings and bulleted entries underneath section headings are actual proposed wording, or suggested sections for a rules document. Text in italics are comments which can be used when a scheme drafts the actual language of a rules document.</p>
<h2 id="1-about-these-scheme-business-rules">1. About These Scheme Business Rules</h2>
<h3 id="11-these-are-the-scheme-business-rules">1.1 These are the Scheme Business Rules.</h3>
<ul><i>Note that the Mojaloop software can be used for bilateral exchanges among DFSPs, as well as within a Scheme structure that uses a switch. This document assumes the latter; that the Scheme is either providing, hiring, or otherwise arranging that interoperable transactions are exchanged through a switch. Some of the concepts in these rules apply only to this configuration; others would be useful in bilateral agreements as well.</i></ul>

<h3 id="12-scheme-ownership">1.2 Scheme Ownership</h3>
<ul><i>Who owns the scheme, what opportunities exist for ownership participation. Reference to other documents (charter, by-laws, etc.)</i></ul>

<h3 id="13-defined-associated-documents">1.3 Defined Associated Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>These rules include the Associated Documents listed in an Appendix to these rules. Associated Documents are part of, and have the force of, the Operating Rules.</li>
</ul>
<ul><i>Associated Documents should include the Platform Operating Guideline and the Uniform Glossary. This does not include various technical documents that may be referenced in the Business Rules or the Platform Operating Guideline.</i></ul>

<h3 id="14-scheme-business-rules-are-binding-on-participants">1.4 Scheme Business Rules are Binding on Participants</h3>
<ul><i>This repeats the provision in the Scheme Participation Agreement. Note that Scheme Business Rules are only binding on the DFSPs that participate in the Scheme. The Scheme may write rules that require certain provisions of these rules be passed on to Participant customers (for example, merchants) or partners (for example, processors) - but this is an obligation of the Participant to the Scheme, not the other parties.</i></ul>

<h3 id="15-rules-may-be-amended">1.5 Rules May Be Amended</h3>
<ul><i>Details of amendment process are specified elsewhere.</i></ul>

<h3 id="16-terms-are-defined-in-uniform-glossary">1.6 Terms are Defined in Uniform Glossary</h3>
<ul><i>The glossary is a separate document, rather than be internal to the Business Rules document. This is to ensure consistency in terminology as the service evolves and the Platform Operating Guideline changes.</i></ul>

<h2 id="2-scheme-goals">2. Scheme Goals</h2>
<ul><i>This is a section that allows a Scheme to state the objectives of the Scheme. We suggest support of interoperable financial transactions, financial inclusion, and gender equality. This is also an opportunity to reference support for the Level One Project Design Principles, a national or regional payments strategy (or digital economy strategy), or a Scheme-specific set of design principles.</i></ul>

<h2 id="3-participation-in-scheme">3. Participation in Scheme</h2>
<h3 id="31-participation-eligibility">3.1 Participation Eligibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eligibility Criteria</li>
</ul>
<ul><i>A statement as to which types of institutions are eligible to apply to be a participant in the Scheme. The Level One design principle is that any licensed provider of transaction accounts in a jurisdiction covered by the Scheme should be eligible to apply</i></ul>

<ul>
<li>Approval Criteria</li>
</ul>
<ul><i>Scheme provisions for acceptance of applications, including high level statements of required information from applicant, such as demonstration of a sustainable ability to meet financial obligations and compliance obligations. The actual application process is in an Appendix to these Rules. The technical certification requirements can be listed in the Platform Operating Guideline.</i></ul>

<h3 id="32-licensing">3.2 Licensing</h3>
<ul><i>This concept may or may not apply when the Scheme operator is a government entity. If the concept to licensing is not included in the rules, there needs to be a provision in &quot;Participation Eligibility&quot; section with respect to terminating a participant.</i></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>A Participant is granted a License to participate in the Scheme and to use the Scheme Property in accordance with the Scheme Business Rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Participant may use Scheme Property only in accordance with the Scheme Business Rules. Licenses will limit use of Scheme Property to the Participant&apos;s provision of services in connection with the Scheme and according to the Rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Licenses will not be exclusive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33-tiered-access">3.3 Tiered Access</h3>
<ul><i>Schemes may choose to allow some applicants to access join the Scheme as indirect participants. This section specifies the conditions for this. Some Schemes separately enable technical indirect participation and settlement indirect participation.</i></ul>

<ul><i>If this is allowed, defined terms (such as Sponsor Bank and Indirect Participant) are required. This section should clearly show what the obligations of each party are; this can refer to the obligation sections appearing later.</i></ul>

<h3 id="34-departure-from-participation">3.4 Departure from Participation</h3>
<ul><i>Provisions for Scheme suspension or termination of a Participant&apos;s participation in the Scheme. The Scheme may suspend, limit or disqualify a Participant from participating in the Scheme if it determines that the Participant&apos;s inability to observe a Rule unduly burdens the Scheme or other Participants or poses undue risks to the integrity of the Scheme or the reputation of the Scheme</i></ul>

<ul><i>Provisions for Participants to terminate their participation in the Scheme</i></ul>

<h2 id="4-scheme-business-rules">4. Scheme Business Rules</h2>

</li>
<li><p>The Scheme may include with the publication of a proposed change its independently determined suggestion for the wording of a change in the Rules,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><i>Scheme should have a defined process for adopting changes, which may include Participant voting or decision by the Scheme. If there is voting, rules here should specify the parameters.</i></ul>
